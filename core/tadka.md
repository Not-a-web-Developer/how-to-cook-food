# The Tadka

So now that you know the basics (go [here][1] if you want a refresher or opened this accidentally without looking back), let's learn how to use the spices to make a tadka (also called chhaunk or छौंक if you can read the devnagari script) which is used in every indian recipe with slight variations.

We're gonna be tackling the south Indian style since it has a lot less variation across recipes and so gets you up and running quicker.

### Ingredients you'll need:

 - your spice-box (go to [the basics][1] if you don't know what goes in the spice-box)
 - white lentils (called urad dal or उड़द दाल in hindi)
 - oil (you can use sunflower oil, groundnut oil, or basically any plant-based oil; however the flavour changes with the type of oil you use, so experiment with what oil tastes the best to you)
 - the utensil you're  gonna cook your food in (could be a sauté pan, a wok, or a kadhai or कढ़ाई in hindi), it basically has to look a bit like these: ![a kadhai and a wok](/core/kadhai-and-wok.jpg) [^1]
  I use a kadhai since that's what I have at home.
 - a cooking stove like a gas-fired stove or an induction stove (duh)

### Steps:

 1. light up the stove and keep the kadhai on it; pour in more than a tablespoon of oil (how much more depends on the amount of food you wanna make) and let it heat until it's just about to start smoking (if it starts smoking, you need to slow down the heat since it's gotten too hot) (I'll add images to show what it's supposed to look like later on, if I haven't done so yet you can open up an issue and ping me to death)

 2. add half a teaspoon of mustard seeds and half a teaspoon of white lentils; they should start crackling as soon as they hit the oil (if they don't, the oil is too cool and you need to wait for it to heat up more)
 
 3. when the cracking seems to slow down (should happen in about 10-15 seconds), add in finely chopped green chili and curry leaves (leaves from the tree [_Murraya koenigii_][2]), the amounts of both being dependent on personal preference (how many leaves to be put in is harder to decide, so a good guide is add in 2-3 leaves per intended serving, meaning if you're making it for 4 people you need to add about 10-12 leaves)
 

#### note:
the oil will make a lot of noise and may splash out, so take care any hot droplets don't hit you and burn your skin.

4. use a spatula to gently but continuously stir the mixture. once the crackling slows down (will take slightly longer than last time), add in finely chopped onions and sauté them until they turn golden.

with this, you have a basic south-indian style tadka ready, and you can move on to [the next document][3] to make something you can actually eat.
