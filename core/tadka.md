# The Tadka

So now that you know the basics (go [here][1] if you want a refresher or opened this accidentally without looking back), let's learn how to use the spices to make a tadka (also called chhaunk or छौंक if you can read the devnagari script) which is used in every indian recipe with slight variations.

We're gonna be tackling the south Indian style since it has a lot less variation across recipes and so gets you up and running quicker.

### Ingredients you'll need:

 - your spice-box (go to [the basics][1] if you don't know what goes in the spice-box)
 - split and dehusked black gram (called urad dal or उड़द दाल in hindi)
 - oil (you can use sunflower oil, groundnut oil, or basically any plant-based oil; however the flavour changes with the type of oil you use, so experiment with what oil tastes the best to you)

 - a cooking stove like a gas-fired stove or an induction stove (duh)

### Steps:

 1. light up the stove and keep the kadhai on it; pour in more than a tablespoon of oil (how much more depends on the amount of food you wanna make) and let it heat until it's just about to start smoking (if it starts smoking, you need to slow down the heat since it's gotten too hot) (I'll add images to show what it's supposed to look like later on, if I haven't done so yet you can open up an issue and ping me to death)
 2. add half a teaspoon of mustard seeds; they should start crackling as soon as they hit the oil (if they don't, the oil is too cool and you need to wait for it to heat up more)
 3. when the cracking
