# The Tadka

So now that you know the basics (go [here][1] if you want a refresher or opened this accidentally without looking back), let's learn how to use the spices to make a tadka (also called chhaunk or छौंक if you can read the devnagari script) which is used in every indian recipe with slight variations.

We're gonna be tackling the south Indian style since it has a lot less variation across recipes and so gets you up and running quicker.

### Ingredients you'll need:

 - your spice-box (go to [the basics][1] if you don't know what goes in the spice-box)
 - split and dehusked black gram (called urad dal or उड़द दाल in hindi)
 - oil (you can use sunflower oil, groundnut oil, or basically any plant-based oil; however the flavour changes with the type of oil you use, so experiment with what oil tastes the best to you)
 - the utensil you're  gonna cook your food in (could be a sauté pan, a wok, or a kadhai or कढ़ाई in hindi), it basically has to look a bit like this: [a kadhai and a wok](/core/kadhai-and-wok.jpg)
