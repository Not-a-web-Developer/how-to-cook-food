# We have breads too.

lots of them in fact.

types of indian bread include (but aren't limited to):

* chapati (cha-paa-tee, the most basic type of flatbread which is made with freshly kneaded whole wheat flour and cooked on a pan);
* phulka (full-kaa, like a chapati but it's also directly kept on the flame in the end to make sure it inflates from the steam the dough gives off while being cooked);
* roti (roh-tee, thicker than a chapati and can be cooked on either a pan or in a [tandoor][1], is a lot heavier on the stomach and may not be preferred by all kinds of people);
* naan (the pronunciation should be easy enough, it's flatbread made from fermented refined flour, oiled and then cooked in a tandoor); and
* kulcha (kull-chaa where the kull should rhyme with full, it's also a flatbread made from fermented refined flour, oiled and cooked in a tandoor; however, it's a lot closer to western bread in texture, while naan is more rubbery than airy)

## Jeez, that's a lot of complexity.

Don't worry, you almost never make the last two by yourself and most people prefer eating only the first two, which are basically the same; learning how to make a phulka should be enough for you as long as you're not trying to be a professional cook, in which case you can do a lot better than some guy's guides on github.
