# The Basics

~~this is still a work in progress.~~

you'll need to keep two things in mind before starting to use this loose collection of guides on how to cook (mostly Indian) food:

 1. Food almost always has more than one ingredient in it (as much as you like it, you can't just eat French Fries and call it a day); and
 2. You can't really make good food without using spices (I'm sorry, but no matter how great your grandma makes mashed potatoes, you can't sell that in a restaurant).

---

now that that's out of the way, here's a list of the spices you'll always need to have in your "toolbox":

 - Turmeric powder
 - Cumin Seeds
 - mustard Seeds
 - Cumin Powder
