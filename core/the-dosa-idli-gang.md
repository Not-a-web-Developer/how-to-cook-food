# Wheat breads aren't everything, you know

you can make many other things that look like indian breads (and fill the same role in the dinner plate) from raw materials other than wheat  

## For example, Rice.

Rice is used a lot for making food, especially in the south where rice is the staple foodgrain. you can make a lot of things from rice batter (the difference between batter and dough is that dough is a sticky solid while batter is a sticky liquid), for example: 
- Dosa
- Idli
- uthappam
- many more i can't think of lol

all of them are made from variations of the batter, but the batter of one of them _can_ be used to make the others if you feel lazy or have some leftover and want to make one of the other dishes.

## Alright! So what's this batter?
woah, woah, calm down there. other foodgrains exist too, but i guess we'll talk about them some other time.

anyway, so to make this you require:
- rice (obviously)
- white lentils

and that's it for the most basic type!

now, for the steps:

1. take 3 parts rice and one part white lentils, and wash them.
2. now, soak them in water for at least 2-3 hours (although i _very sternly_ recommend keeping it overnight), and when you check on them you'll see that they're swollen if you've kept it for the right amount of time.
3. now, you grind it to a paste until it's a slightly thick batter.
4. the batter isn't ready yet though; it needs to rise up which takes quite a while (5-6 hours in a warm envirionment, even more in colder environments; I recommend you to keep it in a place where it doesn't get colder than about 25Â°C)
**Important Note:** since it rises up quite a lot, keep the container in which you leave the batter to be only half full; it'll be full by the time it's ready.

once the batter is ready, you can make many things, but we'll start with the simplest:

## The dosa.

It's basically like a very flat pancake but made from the rice batter we prepared just now.
for this, you need:
- your batter (obviously)
- a stove (duh)
- a flat frying pan (size is technically personal preference, but here in india we say the bigger the better)
- a spatula
- some vegetable oil (optional, you don't need it especially in today's age of teflon-coated non-stick pans, but it gives a different taste to the dosa at the cost of clogging up your arteries in 30 years or less)
- a ladle(?) idk what utensil i use lol; it's like a serving spoon but bigger, all the while not being a ladle.

anyway, now for the steps:

1. light up your stove (or turn it on in case it's an induction hob), and keep your pan on it; let it heat up until just before it starts smoking (as in the case of the tadka, smoking = you've heaten it too much)
2. since the batter has been left untouched for many hours at this point, it may start separating out into water and solid-ish stuff; so it's good practice to stir it for a few seconds with your ladle. Now is also a good time to add salt so that it's not tasteless (amount of salt is to taste, however i recommend about half a tablespoon of salt for every two liters of batter; yes, i know, that's a lot of batter, but hey how are you supposed to feed a family of 4 voracious feeders)
3. now you have to add some batter to your hot pan, and spread it around quickly but without hurrying too much (if that makes any sense) so that there's a thin layer of quickly solidyfing batter on the pan (how much you add depends on the size of the ladle, the size of the pan, how hot the pan is, and your experience as a cook; however I use about one and a half servings of my "ladle" onto my rather large frying pan)
4. if you wanna add oil, you can pour a tiny amount of it on your spatula and then use the spatual to pour drops of oil randomly across the surface of the pan (which should be almost entirely covered by the now-cooking dosa if you did it right).
5. after about a minute or two of waiting (although it really does depend a lot on how much batter your have on the pan, and how hot the pan is), you should try poking at the edge of the dosa with your spatula; the dosa will almost magically start slowly lifting off the pan (if you have a non-stick pan that is; if you have a cast iron pan, ~~put a bunch of oil on the pan before pouring the batter~~ DON'T FOLLOW THIS RECIPE FOR YOUR OWN GOOD)
6. when the dosa has lifted, flip it over, and cook it for about half as much time as before.
7. flip it again, and now you can take the dosa off the pan (you can fold it in half with the spatula for saving space if you want to, but that's a skill that takes practice)

There you have it! your very own dosa. 

## Great! But what do I eat it with?

well, with the [potatoes][1] you made! no but seriously that's usually what it's eaten with, along with a couple of gravies that will be made another time.
